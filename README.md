## Setup for an existing project

Ask your agent:

```text
Use `mvagnon/react-boilerplate` as a reference to adopt boilerplate's conventions, structure, stack, CI/CD, quality scripts, `git` hooks, etc.
Follow its README's "Agent instructions" using `gh` CLI or GitHub MCP.
```

Agent instructions:

1. Read the boilerplate at the requested ref (default: default branch) using `gh` or GitHub MCP; record its commit SHA. Read the target project too; its `AGENTS.md` and conventions take precedence.
2. Present the available features grouped by the categories below. Explicitly ask what to apply and what to exclude in each category. Wait for the user's answer before making changes.
3. Implement only the approved selection, adapting to the target project without duplicates. Use its package manager, update its lockfile, and never downgrade dependencies.
4. Run the affected checks and builds. Report the changes, results and source SHA.

| Category             | Features                                                            |
